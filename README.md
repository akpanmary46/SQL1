# PROBLEM STATEMENT


# RESEARCH QUESTION
THE AIM IS TO FIND SOLUTION TO THE ISSUES FACING DEFORESTATION BY ANSWERINGG THE QUESTIONS BELOW:
QUESTION 1. WHAT ARE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN DEFORESTATION?

QUESTION 2. SHOW THE INCOME GROUPS OF COUNTRIES HAVING TOTAL AREA RANGING FROM 75,000 TO 150,000 SQUARE METER?

QUESTION 3. CALCULATE AVERAGE AREA IN SQUARE MILES FOR COUNTRIES IN THE 'UPPER MIDDLE INCOME REGION'COMPARE THE RESULT WITH THE REST OF THE INCOME CATEGORY.

QUESTION 4. DETERMINE THE TOTAL FOREST AREA IN SQUARE KM FOR COUNTRIES IN THE 'HIGH INCOME'GROUP.COMPARE RESULT WITH THE REST OF THE  INCOME  CATEGORIES.

QUESTION 5. SHOW COUNTRIES FROM EACH REGION(CONTINENT)HAVING THE HIGHEST TOTAL FOREST AREAS

# SKILLS
IN ANALYSING THE DATASET,THE SKILLS USED IN ANALYSING AND DERIVING INSIGHT ARE THE CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION OF DATA,CTE THE DATA 

# DATA SOURCE
THE DATASET USED IN ANALYSING ARE 'FOREST_AREA.CSV' 'LAND_AREA.CSV' AND 'REGION_AREA.CSV'

# TOOLS
SQL SERVER IS THE TOOL USED IN ANALYSING THE DATESET

# DATA CLEANING/DATA TRANSFORMATION
IN ENSURING A GOOD AND WELL CONSTRUCTED DATASET. I WENT THROUGH THE COLUMN FOR DUPLICATE KEY,I CHECKED FOR ERRORS AND INACCURACY AND NULL VALUES WITHIN THE DATASET.BELOW ARE THE STEP USE IN ENSURING THAT THE DATASET IS READY FOR ANALYIS 

1.DATA CHECK

2.CONVERTING DECIMAL VALUES TO 3 DECIMAL PLACES 

3.HANDLING NULL VALUES BY USING THE UPDATE KEY AND THE CASE STATEMENT

SELECT *FROM FOREST WHERE FOREST_AREA_SQKM IS NULL;

SET FOREST_AREA_SQKM = CASE WHEN FOREST_AREA_SQKM IS NULL THEN 0
 ELSE FOREST_AREA_SQKM
 ENDS;

SET FOREST_AREA_SQKM = ROUND (FOREST_AREA_SQKM)
